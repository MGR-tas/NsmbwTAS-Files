# NSMBW TAS Files
New Super Mario Bros Wii Main Category TAS inputs

TAS Tools: https://github.com/MGR-tas/nsmbwTAStudio

Note: At this point in time, these TAS Files are mostly just the product of an input export script, so they don't always have ideal input chunks. (For example, they may repeat `1` and `1,D` 50 times in a row instead of having a repeat command do it.) All hand-crafted input files (most future files/updates) will be better in that way.
