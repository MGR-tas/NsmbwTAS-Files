# NsmbwTAS-Files
New Super Mario Bros Wii TAS inputs

Anyone is welcome to download and replay these files, so if you want to learn how to TAS the game, see why we do certain things, or help find improvements, that can be a good way to do it!

The controller settings, unless otherwise specifiedm are wiimote+nunchuck, with NO gamecube controllers. Any additional instructions for replaying a TAS file will be noted with the commit that added it. The necessary lua scripts to do this can be found in the Scripts folder; NSMBWii_Core.lua goes in the main dolphin directory and the rest go in sys->scripts. These scripts may be updated in the future, but I will make sure that old input files will still be able to be imported with the most up-to-date scripts.

I don't have an IL file for every previous level on here, but if you want to see a specific level that I've done feel free to let me know and I'll add it.
