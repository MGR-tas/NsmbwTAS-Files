# NSMBW TAS Files
New Super Mario Bros Wii Main Category TAS inputs

TAS Tools: https://github.com/MGR-tas/nsmbwTAStudio

Note: Many of these TAS Files are mostly the product of an input export script, so they usually don't have clean inputs (For example, they may repeat `1` and `1,D` 50 times in a row instead of having a repeat command do it). While learning to use the setup, I reccommend refferencing the hand-crafted files. To find hand-made files, check the commit history for any first drafts or level improvements.
