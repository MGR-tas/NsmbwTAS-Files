# NSMBW TAS Files
New Super Mario Bros Wii Main Category TAS inputs

TAS Tools: https://github.com/MGR-tas/nsmbwTAStudio

Miscellaneous TAS Files and fullgame .DTMs: https://github.com/MGR-tas/NsmbwTAS-Additional-Files

Note: Many of these TAS Files are mostly the product of an input export script, so they usually don't have clean inputs (For example, they may repeat `1` and `1,D` 50 times in a row instead of having a repeat command do it). While learning to use the setup, I reccommend refferencing the hand-crafted files. To find hand-made files, check the commit history for any first drafts or level improvements.

## Contributing
If you want to help improve the game's TASes, reach out to me on Discord! All you need to do is to improve a relevent single-level TAS file and send it to me, then I'll verify it and add it to the repository. The best spot to do this is in #project-wip in [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/JxXxKAPKwT)
