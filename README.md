## Contributing
If you want to help improve the game's TASes, reach out to me on Discord! All you need to do is to improve (or first draft) a relevent single-level TAS and send it to me, then I'll verify it and add it to the repository. The best spot to do this is in `#tas-discussion` in the [NSMBW Speedrunning Discord Server](https://discord.gg/T7Nwspm).

If you make any improvements, I'll add you to the contributors list in the relevent categories!
